            "This project explores the intersection of traditional Persian Miniature and digital fluidity. 
            Rather than treating animation merely as a medium for storytelling, I utilized the Morphing technique 
            as an analytical tool to discover new possibilities in Deformation. By transitioning between the 
            classical motifs of the Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp, I sought to capture the 'in-between' moments 
            of form—where tradition meets abstraction. The resulting paintings are not static figures, 
            but frozen frames of a continuous metamorphic process, bridging the gap between historical 
            aesthetics and contemporary visual language."

            This work focuses on the organic evolution of form in a digital environment, 
            where the animation acts as the soul of the static painting.
